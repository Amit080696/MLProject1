Install DVC:
pip install dvc

Initialize DVC:
dvc init

After initializing, you will notice several files and directories created by DVC, such as the .dvc folder and the .dvcignore file.

Track DVC Files with Git:
git add .
git status

You will see new files that have been created by DVC.

Commit the Changes:
git commit -m 'Initialize DVC'

Handle Existing Data:
If you have data already tracked by Git that you want to manage with DVC, you should either remove it from Git tracking or move it to a location outside your Git repository temporarily.

For example, to remove a tracked file:

git rm --cached <file>

Add Data to DVC:
To start tracking a data file with DVC, use the dvc add command:

dvc add artifacts/raw.csv

Track DVC Files with Git Again:
After adding the data to DVC, new DVC-related files will be created. Track these files with Git:

git add artifacts/raw.csv.dvc artifacts/.gitignore

Commit the DVC Changes:

git commit -m 'Track raw data with DVC'
Make Changes to Your Data:
If you make changes to the data, you need to add the updated data to DVC again. For example, if you add a new record to artifacts/raw.csv, run:

dvc add artifacts/raw.csv
